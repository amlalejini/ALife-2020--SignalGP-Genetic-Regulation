# signalgp-genetic-regulation

## Goals

### AltSignalWorld

The goal of AltSignalWorld is (almost) entirely demonstrative. _Does_ function regulation
evolve to solve the problem? Is it easier (given this representation) than using
memory?

Secondarily, are duplication mutations overrepresented in successful lineages?
If so, why? Is it because they add new modules? Or, is it something about the duplicated
material?

- (1) Find reasonable mutation rates & matching mechanisms
- (2) Hand-code memory solution (to confirm that it is possible)
- (3) Memory vs. Regulation vs. Both vs. None
- (4) Are duplications occuring along lineage more often than we would expect by
  chance?

### Division of labor World

Goal: does regulation help w/evolution of division of labor?
