# Experiment Log

## Mutation rate experiments (11/26ish)

Look for reasonable mutation rate + match metric to use going forward.

[See experiment readme for details.](./mut-rate-exps/)

Post-experiment, major changes to matchbin regulator. Need to re-write regulation instructions & run
add vs multiplicative regulator experiment (to pick one to use going forward).

## Regulation type experiments (12/17)

Look at multiplicative vs additive module regulation to decide which to use going forward.
